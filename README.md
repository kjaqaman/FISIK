# FISIK
Framework for the Inference of in Situ Interaction Kinetics from single-molecule imaging data with sub-stoichiometric labeling

FISIK is a stochastic mathematical modeling and model calibration framework (written in Matlab) that is designed to predict the full population interaction kinetics from the subset of interactions observed via single-molecule imaging with sub-stoichiometric labeling.
